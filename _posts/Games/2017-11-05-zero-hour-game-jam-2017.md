Summary: Me and Julia's submission "Satan Cart Horror"


For this year's zero hour game, I again used a title generated by the video
game name generator. My game, "Satan Cart Horror" documents the life of a
person trying to escape from the depths of the underworld on a minecart.
To safe yourself, you must dodge the demons that attact constantly by jumping
out of the cart temporarily by pressing the space bar.
