For this year, the video game name generator gave us the topic "Killer Crowbar DS". Thanks Julia for the artwork.

Keep the convicts from escaping jail by using your mighty crowbar, or something like that.  If all convicts escape, you get buu buu'd.

Controls: Use A/D or left/right arrow to move laterally. Use spacebar to bonk the convicts. Refresh the page to restart the game.
