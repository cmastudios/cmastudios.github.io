<p>After playing some games created by server members in Minecraft, I decided to write some new plugins to make the games more fun and enjoyable. I am currently working on IronBall, a version of soccer for Minecraft. This plugin should serve as the fun replacement for War when it’s ready.</p>
<p>New versions of core software for the cmastudios server are coming out soon. This means the server will be a bit faster (notably the every ~10 minute lag spikes will be gone.) I am also getting together the world management functions so user-controlled worlds will be a reality.</p>
<p>The plugin “Minecraft War” was removed from the server due to lag issues. I still enjoy the plugin and help develop it. Solving the lag issues will require a lot of work, which I intend to spend over the summer.</p>
