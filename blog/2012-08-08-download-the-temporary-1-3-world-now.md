I promised that I would allow people to download the save used when 1.3 first came out till Bukkit released a recommended build. It became much larger than I expected it would be (156 MB). <del datetime="2012-09-15T02:16:23+00:00">You will need a BitTorrent program to download it, because I can&#8217;t put the download directly on my site due to the size. I recommend using uTorrent (google it). Here is a magnet link to download it with: <a href="http://cur.lv/2nbo ">(click me)</a> <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:A7DE77946C0101C50D94D07838B4B6C21678EB75&dn=1.3tempworld&tr=udp%3a//tracker.openbittorrent.com%3a80">(alternate)</a>.</del> **UPDATE:** I have discontinued seeding due to the fact that either no one wanted to download it or no one could connect.
