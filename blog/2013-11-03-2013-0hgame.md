summary: Me and Vel0h's submission "Cosmic Soccer Battle"
---
Me and [vel0h](https://github.com/vel0h) made a game for the [0hgame](http://0hgame.eu) initiative this year! This is a jam where you make a game in &#8220;zero hours&#8221;: the one hour loss during daylight savings time. As you can guess, the quality of the game won&#8217;t be the best, but that&#8217;s the whole point of a jam!

# Cosmic Soccer Battle

Defend your home field against cosmic invaders! Play as the ghost, launching your soccer ball towards the aliens to take them out. A shot in the opposing goal wipes the board. A shot in your goal makes the situation worse!

## Play the game

[Download the video game executable](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cmastore/0hgame/2013-build.zip). Extract the ZIP, then run game.bat for windows or game.sh for mac/linux.

[Download source code](https://github.com/cmastudios/0hgame-2013/)

### Controls
Use WASD to move, SPACE to fire your soccer ball. Avoid running into aliens. Shoot for the other team&#8217;s goal or aliens. The ball will travel in the direction you are currently moving.
