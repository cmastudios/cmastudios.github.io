<p>Today I attempted to download a game I wrote many years ago as a little kid to play again for a small dose of nostalgia. What do I find? Norton removed the file not because it contained a virus, but due to a “reputation” algorithm. I would never inject malicious code into my applications, however the multitude of users relying on such “Anti-virus” software would see the alert and forever remember me as a person attempting to cause harm to their computers. A simple “helpful” algorithm intended to prevent viruses leads to lost trust in applications developers and hurt feelings for game makers simply attempting to replay their past creations.</p>
