<p>School has once again started up again for me, which means Iâ€™ll have a minimal amount of time to spend improving the Minecraft server and server plugins. However, I have a lot of time available on Labor Day weekend. I plan to use this time to work on many Minecraft-War feature requests and potentially collaborate to get the new format done with tommytony, founder of the plugin.</p>
<p>The main problem I am currently dealing with in War is a lot of bugs that seem to never die. These will require a significant rewrite to improve, as they are mostly ancient code from the early days of War. Nevertheless, I am committed to making War the best PVP arena experience you can possibly get in Minecraft survival multiplayer.</p>
