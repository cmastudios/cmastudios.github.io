Being the type of person who learns by examples, reading information on Wikipedia and given a synopsis by another person is not enough to totally understand a concept. There is a guide that, in my opinion, gives a nice overview of how this measure of function efficiency works. I recommend visiting [A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Big O Notation](http://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/). It was very helpful for me, and I hope it can be useful to you.
