_I love Warhub&#8217;s karma system! It makes ranking players so much easier! Can you please give it to me?_ tommytony started giving out his version of karma to players who asked this. The downside with this is that players were forced to use GroupManager, have the exact same ranks as the Warhub, and nothing was customizable. This is why I made Karma+, which you can download and view information about [here](http://cmastudios.me/wiki/Karma "Karma - cmastudios wiki").
