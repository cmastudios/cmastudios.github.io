Karma is now available for download from the official [Bukkit plugins repository](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/karma-ranking/). I have decided to release it there to help out other server administrators who need a rock-solid auto ranking system. This version, v1.0, also comes with [a plethora of fixes and new features](http://issue.tommytony.us/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000&version=10002).
