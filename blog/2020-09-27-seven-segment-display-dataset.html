<p>The original venue for this post is on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/j10ub1/p_like_mnist_but_for_7segment_displays/">r/MachineLearning</a>, reposted here as I have a working blog now.</p>
<p>I was recently working on a data analysis project, part of which needed to detect the value of a seven segment display. I started by applying an MNIST-trained model, but the error was very high. I went looking for a different dataset and was not finding any easily accessible ones. Eventually, I found this <a href="https://bitbucket.org/eoinf96/7-segmentdigitgenerator/src/master/">image generator</a> that was designed to create datasets with seven segment display computer-generated images. I used it to create a dataset with ~17k samples, 0-9 digits. It worked well for my project, where I applied it with a random forest model. I don’t plan to write a paper so thought I’d leave the dataset here, to save someone else a few hours if faced with a similar task.</p>
<p>Link to dataset:
<a href="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public.connor.money/sevensegdataset.npy">

</p>
<p>Images are 28x28, flattened here.</p>
<pre><code>features = np.load(&quot;sevensegdataset.npy&quot;)
X = features[:, :-1]
Y = features[:, -1]</code></pre>
