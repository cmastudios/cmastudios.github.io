Earlier today I received an email from a server member requesting an appeal. I sifted through some ancient log files in order to determine how to take this appeal. In the end I decided the evidence against this user was too great to just pardon the user and call it a day. I needed more information from the user. I prepared a super-long email with the appropriate log entries to explain my case to the player. In the end I got this email back:

<pre>Subject: UNBAN U U JERK!!!!!
I USE TO BE FRIENDS HES NOT MY FRIEND U JERK UNBAN ME NOW !!!! NOW I MEAN IT</pre>

A couple of minutes afterward, I received another email:

<pre>Subject: UNBAN ME UNBAN ME
PLEASE UNBEN ME I DIENT DO ANYTHING WRONG PLEASE UNBAN ME
I REALLY WANT TO BE UNABAN</pre>

Needless to say, he has not been unbanned.
