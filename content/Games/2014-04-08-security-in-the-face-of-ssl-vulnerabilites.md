Just yesterday, the news broke of a large exploit in popular software that powers the security of large parts of the internet. Within minutes of hearing about it for the first time, I took action to protect my website, even though it was midnight and I was super tired.

My website was secured well before some other large ones were. For extra security, I generated new security keys (my certificate was to expire in a week anyway). Hopefully an exploit of this magnitude will not occur again anytime soon.
