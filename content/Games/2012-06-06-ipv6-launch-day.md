<img class="alignleft" title="IPv6 launch icon" src="//www.worldipv6launch.org/wp-content/themes/ipv6_new/img/logo-top.png" alt="" width="194" height="232" />Today is World IPv6 Launch Day, when many ISP&#8217;s, major websites, and device manufacturers are starting to add IPv6 support. Why is this important? With our current IP setup, ip addresses look like this: 123.45.678.9. These addresses can only store up to 4 billion addresses. We have already exceeded that limit with all our different devices. This new standard can hold significantly more addresses, up toÂ 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (a ton). Unfortunately, my website won&#8217;t see IPv6 support too soon thanks to the fact that my ISP doesn&#8217;t have support for IPv6 yet and my current router is IPv4 only. I hope to add my AAAA record as soon as possible, though!
