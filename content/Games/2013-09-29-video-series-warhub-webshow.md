Me and some of my friends are going to be starting up a new video series of us playing different mini games together. There will be much more than just mini games though. We plan on having discussions sometimes regarding our game server add-ons and various things that we do. Playing SMP-PvP games of War is also something we plan on doing to showcase our add-on.
  
We will be starting the series off by playing &#8220;MineZ&#8221; &#8211; a version of the popular post-apocalyptic zombie survival mod DayZ for Arma II. Also expect some videos showcasing changes to the War plugin version 1.8.
  
All videos will be posted to the TeamWar YouTube channel and some highlights may make their way onto the blog as well. I will keep you guys posted on our plans and updates.
