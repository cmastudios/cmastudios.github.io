      <p>
        <a name="3"></a>Apparently, over atÂ <a href="http://minecraft.net/">minecraft.net</a>, the team finally decided to remove Notch&#8217;s blog and twitter feed from the page. The blog was replaced with the Minecraft update news stream. Jeb&#8217;s twitter was added in place of Notch&#8217;s. It makes sense now that Jeb is the head of Minecraft, but it is just sad as the starter of the project, company, and for most of the time the only developer, has been totally removed.
