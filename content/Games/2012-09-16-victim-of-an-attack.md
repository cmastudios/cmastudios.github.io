Earlier today, my entire server system froze. I was able to execute a command, but there was no output for a minute and my minecraft server would not respond. I was able to check processes, though, and noticed a ton of processes from the web server. After hard-resetting the server and waiting 20 minutes for disk errors to fix, I checked the web logs and noticed there was a ton of spam from one particular IP. I have blocked this IP address and implemented a variety of protections to prevent this sort of thing from occuring again.
