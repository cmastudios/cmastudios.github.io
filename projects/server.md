This is the home of my minecraft server. We have tons of cool additions to enhance your building experience.

We have a lot of custom software to prevent your creations from being ruined by evil players. The server allows for self-protection of land.  Forgot to protect your creation? We have additional software to revert destructions on unprotected land as well.

&nbsp;

We have lots of active players on the server. Want to do a community build, like a town? No problem! You are certain to receive plenty of help from our player base.

Is there not enough space to build? Look on the [server map](http://cmastudios.me/~minecraft/) and you&#8217;ll be sure to find a nice, quiet area to call home. You will also be able to find lots of neat builds made by others that you can visit.

Join cmastudios.me today!

**(tl;dr?)**

This server is a anti-grief freebuild flat creative server with lots of cool plugins.
